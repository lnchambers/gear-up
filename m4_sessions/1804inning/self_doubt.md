Name of Session: You Probably Won't Come To This Session, You'd Rather Be Working On Your Project

Session Description (Why should students come to this session): Your project deadline is coming up, and you doubt you'll even finish it. It seems like everyone is ahead of you. You're probably going to repeat anyway. Why did you even come to Turing in the first place? You probably stopped reading this already, because we doubt this description is helpful at all, but come learn how self-doubt is impeding your learning 

Session Outcomes (What will students learn/leave with?): Students will leave with confidence to do something that they don't know how to do. Leave with strategies to cope with when doubt creeps.
